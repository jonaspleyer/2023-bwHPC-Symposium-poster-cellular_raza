\begin{abstract}
    This paper uses \texttt{cellular\_raza} to develop a model with cell-type specific interactions
    whereby cells self-assemble into regions of similar species which is also known as cell-sorting.
    We use this model to asses the parallelization performance of the numerical backend at the core
    of \texttt{cellular\_raza} and show that values of up to $p=97.78\pm0.14\%$ parallelizable code
    can be achieved, which indicates a high level of parallelizability.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
% ##################################################################################################

\texttt{cellular\_raza} is a cellular agent-based modeling framework~\cite{Pleyer2023} which 
allows researchers to construct models from a clean slate.
In contrast to other agent-based modelling toolkits, it is free of assumptions about the underlying
cellular representation.
This enables researchers to build up complex models while retaining full control over every
parameter and behaviour introduced.

At the 9th bwHPC Symposium 2023, we presented a very compacted variety of applications and analytics
of \texttt{cellular\_raza}~\cite{PeaceOfPostersbwHPC}.
Here, we focus on the cell-sorting example which was also presented but has been refined since then.
We refer the interested reader to the documentation website
\href{https://cellular-raza.com}{cellular-raza.com} where one can find the full documentation,
remaining examples and information about the underlying assumptions and methods which we leveraged
in the development of \texttt{cellular\_raza}.

\section{Cell Sorting}
\label{sec:cell-sorting}
% ##################################################################################################

Cell Sorting is a naturally occuring phenomenon which drives many biological
processes~\cite{Steinberg1963,Graner1992}.
While the biological reality can be quite complex, it is rather simple to describe such
a system in its most basic form.
The underlying principle is that interactions between cells are specific with respect to their type.

\paragraph{Mathematical Description}
We assume that our cells are spherical objects which interact via force potentials.
The values $R_i,R_j$ are the radii of the cells ($i\neq j$) interacting with each other.
For simplification, we can assume that they are identical $R_i=R_j=R$.
The two positions of cells are $x_i,x_j$ and their distance is $r_{i,j}=||x_i-x_j||$.
Furthermore, we assume that the equation of motion is given by

\begin{equation}
    \partial^2_t \vec{x}_i = \vec{F}_i - \lambda \partial_t \vec{x}_i
\end{equation}

where the first term is the usual force term $\vec{F}_i = - \sum_j\vec{\nabla} V_{i,j}$ obtained by
differentiating the given potential and the second term is a damping term which arises due to the
cells being immersed inside a viscuous fluid.
Note that we rescaled the units of our parameters in order to normalize our mass to $m=1$.
This means, every parameter can be expressed in units of length and time.

We can assume that interactions between cells are restricted to close ranges and thus enforce a
cutoff $\xi\geq R_i+R_j$ for the interaction where the resulting force is identical to zero.
We further assume that cells of different species do not attract each other but do repel.
To describe this behaviour, we set the potential to zero when $r>R_i+R_j$ (i.e., $\kappa_{i,j}>1$)
and both cells have distinct species type $s_i$.

\begin{align}
    \kappa_{i,j} &= \frac{r_{i,j}}{R_i + R_j}\\
    U_{i,j} &= V_0 \left(\frac{1}{3\kappa_{i,j}^3} - \frac{1}{\kappa_{i,j}}\right)\\
    V_{i,j} &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 &\text{ if } \kappa_{i,j}\geq\xi/(R_i+R_j)\\
        0 &\text{ if } s_i\neq s_j \text{ and } \kappa_{i,j}\geq 1\\
        U(\kappa_{i,j}) &\text{ else }
    \end{cases}.
\end{align}

\paragraph{Parameters}
In total, we are left with only 4 cellular parameters to describe our system.
In order to fully specify the system, we also need to define the time for which we are solving, the
overall physical size and the initial number of agents which we put into the simulation.
Their values  are given in Table~\ref{tab:cell-sorting-parameters}.

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l c c}
        Parameter & Symbol & Value\\
        \hline
        Cell Radius & $R_i$ & $\SI{6}{\micro\metre}$\\
        Potential Strength & $V_0$ & $\SI{2}{\micro\metre^2\per\minute^2}$\\
        Damping Constant & $\lambda$ & $\SI{2}{\per\minute}$\\
        Interaction Range & $\xi$ & $1.5 (R_i+R_j)=3R_i$\\
        \hline
        Time Stepsize & $\Delta t$ & $\SI{0.2}{\minute}$\\
        Time Steps & $N_t$ & $10'000$\\
        Domain Size & $L$ & $110\text{ µm}$\\
        Cells Species 1 & $N_{C,1}$ & $800$\\
        Cells Species 2 & $N_{C,2}$ & $800$\\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{
        This table shows two sections containing parameters and other variables respectively which
        to fully specify and initialize the system.
        In total, 1600 cells with random initial positions and zero velocity were placed inside the
        domain.
    }
    \label{tab:cell-sorting-parameters}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Results}
Figure~\ref{fig:cell-sorting-results} shows the inital placement of the cells and their final state.
We can clearly see that the cells have assembled into connected regions of the same species.
The size of these regions depends on the interaction range and its strength.
In this example, we did not assume any stochastic motion of the cells.
It is to be noted that this assumption is not required by \texttt{cellular\_raza} but rather a
free choice of the model.
Depending on the desired complexity, users can substantially modify the cellular representation,
which is the main reason for the development of \texttt{cellular\_raza}.
We provide two additional
\href{https://github.com/jonaspleyer/cellular_raza/tree/master/cellular_raza-examples/cell_sorting}{examples}
which implement mechanics with Brownian~\cite{Schlick2002} and
Langevin~\cite{Schlick2002,Pastor1994} dynamics but even more complex cellular representations are
possible as well (see eg. \href{https://cellular-raza.com/showcase/bacterial-rods}{bacterial-rods}).

\section{Multithreading Performance (Amdahl's Law)}
% ##################################################################################################

\paragraph{Theory}
One measure of multithreaded performance is to calculate the possible theoretical speedup
given by Amdahl's law~\cite{Rodgers1985}.
It provides an estimate for the speedup and assumes that the workload can be split into a
parallelizable and non-parallelizable part which is quantified by $0\leq p \leq1$.
A higher value means that the contribution coming from non-parallelizable algorithms is lower.
The theoretical maximum $p=1$ means that all of the executed code is parallelizable.
Amdahl's law is given by

\begin{equation}
    T(n) = T_0\frac{1}{(1-p) + \frac{p}{n}}
    \label{eq:amdahls-law}
\end{equation}

where $T(n)$ describes the throughput which can be achieved given $n$ parallel threads and the
variable $p$ is the relative proportion of execution time which benefits from parallelization.
The total latency of a program can be determined via the inverse of the throughput.

\paragraph{Simulation Setup}
Measuring the performance of any simulation will be highly dependent on the specific cellular 
properties and complexity.
For this comparison, we chose the previously explained cell-sorting example which contains minimal
complexity compared to other examples (see
\href{https://cellular-raza.com/showcase}{cellular-raza.com/showcase}).
Any computational overhead which is intrinsic to \texttt{cellular\_raza} and not related to the
chosen example would thus be more likely to manifest itself in performance results.

In order to produce reproducible results and simplify this overall process, we provide the
\href{https://github.com/jonaspleyer/cellular_raza/tree/master/cellular_raza-benchmarks}{cellular\_raza-benchmarks} crate.
It is a command-line utility which can be used to run benchmarks with various configurations.
Its arguments are displayed in Listing~\ref{listing:benchmarks-cli}.

Results generated in this way are stored inside the \texttt{benchmark\_results} folder.
In addition, we provide a python script \texttt{plotting/cell\_sorting.py} to quickly visualize
the obtained results.

\paragraph{Hardware}
This benchmark was run on three distinct hardware configurations.
There exists a wide range of variables which could influence our measured runtime results.
However, we expect that the biggest effects are due to power-limits and variable frequency of the
central processing unit (CPU) (see Figure~\ref{tab:hardware-configurations}).
Both of these effects can be circumvented by choosing an artificially fixed frequency which is low
enough such that the total power limit of the CPU is never reached even when multiple cores are
under load.
While it is well known that other aspects such as cache-size and memory latency can have an impact
on absolute performance, they should however not introduce any significant deviations in terms of
relative performance scaling.

    \caption{Performance of the throughput $T(n)$ for increasing number of utilized threads $n$.}
    \label{fig:amdahls-law-fit}
\end{figure}

In figure~\ref{fig:amdahls-law-fit}, we fit Amdahl's law of equation~\ref{eq:amdahls-law} to our
measured datapoints and obtain the parameter $p$ from which the theoretical maximal speedup $S$ can
be calculated via

\begin{equation}
    S = \lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty} T(n) = \frac{1}{1-p}
    \label{eq:amdahls-law-maximum-speedup}
\end{equation}

The values for the maximum theoretical speedup are $S_\text{3700X}=13.64\pm1.73$,
$S_\text{3960X}=44.99\pm2.80$ and $S_\text{12700H}=34.74\pm5.05$.
Their uncertainty $\sigma(S)$ can be calculated via the standard gaussian propagation

\begin{equation}
    \sigma(S) = \frac{\sigma(p)}{(1-p)^2}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma(p)$ is the uncertainty of the parameter $p$ obtained via the fit in
figure~\ref{fig:amdahls-law-fit}.

\section{Discussion}
In a real-world scenario, the perfect score of a fully parallelizable system with $p=1$ is
considered unobtainable due to effects such as the workload of the underlying operating system and
physical constraints.
Additionally, the findings of this study demonstrate that the calculated value of $p$ is contingent
on the specific hardware utilized, and a subset of the simulation code, amounting to $1-p$, is
inherently non-parallelizable.
This phenomenon can be partially attributed to the initial configuration of the simulation, which is
required to commence in a single-threaded manner.
Only subsequent to the generation of all respective
\href{https://cellular-raza.com/docs/cellular_raza_core/backend/chili/struct.SubDomainBox.html}
{subdomains} can the simulation transition to a state of execution involving multiple workers.
Furthermore, the termination of the simulation results in the freeing of resources which also
requires computational resources.
Additionally, this action locks the main routine until the completion of all individual threads.
In the context of \texttt{cellular\_raza}, all threads are currently utilizing a shared
barrier~\cite{GjengsetHurdles2018} to synchronize with each other.
This configuration results in a scenario in which a single worker has the potential to obstruct the
operations of all others.
This limitation may be addressed in future iterations of \texttt{cellular\_raza}.
It should be noted that this is merely an implementation detail and not a fundamental restriction.
Nonetheless, the aggregate acceleration $S$ obtained in our configurations allows for remarkably
effective parallelization.
This can be directly ascribed to the implementation and the fundamental assumption of
\texttt{cellular\_raza} that all Interactions are strictly local, and subdomains only interact along
their borders.

% ##################################################################################################

We demonstrated the application of \texttt{cellular\_raza} as a modeling framework for cellular
biological systems, utilizing a case study involving cell sorting as an illustrative example.
The modeling process is characterized by its flexibility, attributable to the variety of cellular
representations that are supported.
We selected a model that utilizes a mere four parameters to represent the cells, thereby elucidating
their physical characteristics and interactions.
The numerical results demonstrated the anticipated behavior of cells assembling into connected
regions of identical species.
The performance of the numerical backend was benchmarked using the cell-sorting simulation.
A simulation of sufficient magnitude was selected to saturate all processors, and the number of
threads utilized was gradually increased.
The fractional amount of parallelizable code was determined by fitting the values of runtime to
Amdahl's law.
It reached $97.78\%$ for a workstation setup, indicating a well-parallelizable implementation.
